                Galle Fort, also known as the Dutch Fort or the "Ramparts of Galle", is located in the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka and is built on a rocky peninsula.
                <br>
                It was first built in 1588 by the Portuguese, then extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument, which even after more than 400 years maintains a polished appearance due to the extensive reconstruction work done by Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka.
                <br>
                <br>
                The fort has a colourful history, and today has a multi-ethnic and multi-religious population in the surrounding areas.

                The Portuguese made their first landing on the island in 1505. They joined forces with the then King Dharmaparakrama Bahu and made notable changes in the development of the island.
                <br>
                Eventually, the Portuguese built a fort at the habour they first arrived at and a Franciscan chapel inside the fort in 1541. The fort, in later years, served as a prison to camp to incarcerate Sinhalese natives who opposed the Portuguese.
                Later, the Portuguese moved to Colombo from Galle as they preferred the latter.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1588, however, they were attacked by the Sinhalese King Raja Singha I and were forced to retreat to Galle.
                At Galle, they initially built a small fort out of palm trees and mud. They called it the Santa Cruz, and later extended it with a watch tower and three bastions to guard the habour.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1640, the Dutch with some 2,500 soldiers joined hands with King Rajasinhe II and captured the fort from the Portuguese. After capturing the fort, the Dutch added fortifications up to the early 18th century.
                <br>
                They also built public administration buildings, warehouses and business houses and residential quarters. A Protestant church, the oldest in Sri Lanka, was also built in baroque style in 1775 to cater to the colonists and the local people who were converted to Christianity. The most important buildings inside the fort were the Commandant's residence, the arsenal and the gun house. They also built a system of sewers that took sewage away to sea.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1796, the British took control of the fort after they invaded Sri Lanka.
                <br>
                Under their control, the British made the fort their southern headquarters and made many modifications to the fort, such as closing the moat, building houses, a lighthouse, a heavily fortified gate and finally a tower in 1883. During the Second World War the British built many more fortifications to defend the fort.

                The fortifications added to the fort by the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British, although in ruins, still remain at the site.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Portuguese were the first to build any kind of fortifications to the fort. They built a wall made of wood and three bastions. They did not fortify the wall on the seaside since they believed it to be impregnable.
                <br>
                <br>
                When the Dutch assumed control of the fort they considered the Portuguese defences to be unsafe since they were built from earthly elements such as wood and mud. Hence, the Dutch built 13 more bastions with coral and granite stones over an area of 52 hectares. Many of the fortification walls were built in 1663. The sea wall was completed in 1729. The Dutch also built a heavy vertically-closing gate in 1669. The gate was protected by a drawbridge and a ditch.
                <br>
                <br>
                Later a new, main gate was built by the British in 1873.

            <p class="main-para">
                The urban area within the fort has a rectangular grid pattern of streets full of low houses with gables and verandahs in the Dutch colonial style.
                <br>
                It has a well laid out road network with the peripheral roads aligned parallel to the fort's ramparts. The fort area also has a number of historic churches, mosques, commercial and government buildings.
                <br>
                <br>
                Many buildings are of Dutch vintage with street names also in Dutch. Most of the street names are a legacy from the colonial period.

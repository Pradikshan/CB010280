        <h2>Animal Sanctuaries</h2>
        <p>
            Animal sanctuaries provide care for rescued animals and look after them for the rest of their lives.
            In a sanctuary the residents come first, as such a sanctuary eliminates any activity or entity that would stress out the animals.
            <br>
            This in turn provides an authentic view into the behaviour and daily life routines of the animals.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Sri Lanka, the most popular wildlife sanctuary is the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage.

            It is popular for its golden, sandy beaches and nightlife, but what captivates the interest of most nature lovers is because Mirissa is the island's main whale and dolphin watching location.

            In fact, Mirissa is ranked as the top ten whale-watching destinations in the world. Most people who go on whale watching in Mirissa are likely to catch the glimpse of a blue or a sperm whale since there are tons of krill around here that the whales feast on, and there's an annual migration of blue and sperm whales between the Bay of the Bengal and the Arabian Sea, via the coast of Sri Lanka.

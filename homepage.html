            Sri Lanka, also known as the pearl of the Indian Ocean and Ceylon, is an island nation the size of Ireland in South Asia lying in the Indian Ocean and separated from peninsular India by the Palk Strait.
            <br>
            Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is Sri Lanka's capital city while Colombo is the biggest city in Sri Lanka.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sri Lanka's close proximity to the Indian subcontinent has enabled close cultural relations between India and Sri Lanka since early times.
            <br>
            Also, Sri Lanka's geographic location in the Indian Ocean and deep harbours has made it a major trading hub since ancient days and exposed the island to many different cultures, especially those from Asian civilisations, and influenced many of the current cultures and customs present in the island to this day.  
            <br> 
            <br>
            <br>
            However, before you visit Sri Lanka wouldn't you like to know more about the country. That's why we have complied some useful information for visitors about our wonderful island nation.

        <h2>The Land of Sri Lanka</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="./images/Homepage/land.webp" alt="Sri Lanka" class="main-img">
        </figure>
        <p>
            The heart of the country lies in the south-central region of the country. This south-central region of the country is commonly known as the Central Highlands.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Central Highlands is a mountainous area, and Sri Lanka's highest mountains such as Pidurutalagala, Kirigalpotta, and Adam's Peak are found in this area. The regions surrrounding the Central Highlands consists of various geological features. The north and noertheast regions of the island include low mountains that decrease in altitude as they near the coast.
            <br>
            While the western and southwestern parts of the island has mountains and valleys that run parrallel to the coast. The rest of the regions are made up of mountains of varing altitudes.
            <br>
            The coastal region of island include sandy beaches, spits, lagoons, deep-water bays, and offshore islets.    
        </p>
        <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>
            Sri Lanka's close proximity to the equator makes it a tropical country. Therefore the average temperature in the country is between 22째C and 33째C.
            <br>
            But in the Central Highlands the average monthly temperature ranges between 7째C and 21.6째C. These lower temperatures are a result of the high altitude of the Central Highlands.
            <br>
            Rainfall plays a major role in influencing the climate in Sri Lanka. Most parts of the island receive an average annual rainfall of more than 1,270mm.
            <br>
            However, the intensity of the amount of rainfall varies from region to region and allows to form a distinction between regions as dry zones and wet zones.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the southwestern part of the country -the wet zone-  rainfall is quite heavy with the highlands receiving an average rainfall of upto 3,810mm and decreasing in magnitude towards coast with an average rainfall of 2,490mm. This extreme rainfall in the southwestern region occurs mostly from May to September.
            <br>
            <br>
            The rest of the island -the dry zone- receives an average rainfall ranging from 762mm to 1778mm from November to January, but this amount of rainfall is comparatively low to that of the wet zone.
            <br>
            Even though the rainfall in Sri Lanka is moderate it common, especially in the northern region of the country, for Sri Lanka to experience droughts lasting upto three months.       
        </p>
        <h3>Plant and animal life</h3>
        <p>
            The natural vegetation in Sri Lanka consists mostly of forests and covers upto 35% of the total land area.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tropical wet evergreen dominate the natural vegetation in the lowlands in the wet zone and in the highlands evergreen forests are littered on mountains.
            <br>
            The dry zone consists of a hybrid vegetation of dry evergreen forests and moist deciduous forests, but shrubby, drought-torelant vegetation is present in the drier parts of the dry zone.
            <br>
            <br>
            The wildlife of Sri Lanka is made up of elephants, leopards, bears, buffalo, peafowl and a variety of birds.

        <h2>The culture and people of Sri Lanka</h2>

        </figure>
        <h3>The cultural life of Sri Lanka</h3>
        <p>
            Sri Lanka is a land of cultural diversity, and religion plays an important part in this diversification.
            <br>
            Buddhist and Hindu temples, churches and mosques are found everywhere around the country.      
        </p>
        <h3>Ethnic composition</h3>
        <p>
            The three most widely spread ethnic groups in Sri Lanka are the Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim.
            <br>
            These three groups alone make up for more than 99% of the country's population, but a staggering 75% of the population is composed of Sinhalese people.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Tamils are divided into two groups - Sri Lankan Tamils (long-settled descendants from southeastern India) and Indian Tamils (recent immigrants from southeastern India, most of whom were migrant workers brought to Sri Lanka under British rule).
            <br>
            <br>
            About 13% of the population includes Muslims whose origins can be traced back Arab traders from the 8th century.
            <br>
            <br>
            Burghers (a community of mixed European descent), Parsis (immigrants from western India), and Veddas (regarded as the indigenous people of the country) total less than 1 percent of the population.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Sinhalese are predominantly present in the southern, western, central, and north-central areas of the country. While the Sri Lankan Tamils mostly populate the northern part of the country, especially Jaffna, but smaller groups are present in the eastern parts of the country too. The Indian Tamils, however, occupy the Central Highlands. Muslim clusters can be found mainly in the eastern lowlands. In areas such as Colombo, Kandy, Puttalam, and Gampaha smaller groups of Muslims are present.       
        </p>
        <h3>Language and religion</h3>
        <p>
            The most commonly spoken languages in Sri Lanka are Sinhala, Tamil, and English.
            <br>
            <br>
            The official language of Sri Lanka is Sinhala. The mother tougue of the Sinhalese is Sinhala while the Tamils natively speak Tamil and the muslims usually speak Tamil. About 90% of the Sinhalese are Buddhists. Both Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils are mostly Hindus, and the Muslims are followers of Islam. Christianity draws its followers (about 7 percent of the population) from among the Sinhalese, Tamil, and Burgher communities.

            The "main-title" class is given to the heading across all html pages which is displayed atop the background image in the header of the website.

            The "main-img" class is given to images which commandeers a big portion of the screen.
            To avoid confusion other images are given the same class with a slight variation such as "main-img2".
            But at times the images are given a completely different class which is appropriate to the content they are displaying, for example the image class "hotel-img" in the beaches page. This class was given since the image represents the mentioned hotel.
            
            Headings other than h1 are not given any classes since it was deemed unnecessary from a design perspective. (but there are a few exceptions :)

            The first paragraph which is situated right after the header is given the class "main-para" to differentiate it from the other paragraphs since the "main-para" requires specific styles compared to the rest of the paragraphs. But paragraphs with special classes such as "terms-para" in the footer of the page can be seen since they too require special stylings.

            At every possible venue article and section tags have been used instead of the <div> but the div tag is used sparingly at times. this decision was made since the article and section tag seemed more suitable compared to the div tag given the context of the content in the webpages.

            All images are in the .webp format since they are favoured over the traditional .png or .jpeg formats.

            Everything is spaced out with break lines which might make the code look long but this was done to differentiate between different types of code and to not make everything look cluttered up and ugly.

            <p>
                Dambulla cave temple, also known as the Golden Temple of Dambulla, located in central Sri Lanka is the largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka.
                <br>
                <br>
                The cave complex is a massive structure overlooking the surrounding plains at 160m above ground. There are more than 80 documented caves in the area, but the major attractions are spread over five caves containing several paintings and statues. These paintings and statues are related to Gautama Buddha and his life.
                <br>
                There are a total of 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of gods and goddesses. The murals cover an area of 2,100 square metres in the interior of the caves. The overall form and design as well as the materials and substance of the mural paintings that cover the interior surfaces of the cave shrines, the rock-cut and moulded statuary within the caves have been retained. No interventions have been carried out to change the overall form and design of the interior spaces of the caves, or the location and positioning of sculptures and paintings in relation to their interior layouts. The interior spaces are still being used by pilgrims for ritual Buddhist practices, thus maintaining the original use and function as well as the spirit and feeling of their interior spaces.  
            </p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/Dambulla/temple.webp" alt="Temple" class="main-img">
            </figure>
            <p>
                It is likely that prehistoric humans lived in these cave complexes before the arrival of Buddhism to Sri Lanka as burial sites with skeletons over 2700 years old were found in the nearby areas.
                <br>
                However, the temple complex dates back to first century BCE and was built at the base of the rock during the first century BCE to 993 AD and 1073 to 1250.
                <br>
                The complex was established as the largest and important monastery back in the second and third centuires BC.
                <br>
                <br>
                Dambulla cave monastery is still functional and remains the best-preserved ancient heritage site in Sri Lanka.      
            </p>

            <h2>The five caves and their structure</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/Dambulla/Dambulla-buddha.webp" alt="Cave" class="main-img">

            </figure>
            <p>
                The temple is made up of five caves of varying sizes and these caves are among the most impressive cave temples found in the South East Asian region.
                <br>
                The largest cave measures about 52m from east to west, and 23m from the entrance to the back, this cave's ceiling is 7m tall when measured from the ground.
                <br>
                <br>
                The vast internal spaces of the caves are not divided into sections, but are spatially differentiated by a deliberate and subtle arrangement of polychrome sculpture of exceptional craftsmanship and decorated with brilliant compositions of mural paintings.
                <br>
                This type of interior layout devoid of physical divisions lead the devotees systematically through the spaces from one ritual function to the next.               
            </p>
            <h3>Cave of the Divine King</h3>
            <figure class="container">
                <img src="./images/Dambulla/14m.webp" alt="Statue" class="main-img2">
                <img src="./images/Dambulla/murals.webp" alt="Mural" class="main-img3">
            </figure>
            <p>
                The first cave is called Devaraja lena (in sinhala), or "Cave of the Divine King".
                <br>
                <br>
                An account of the founding of the monastery is recorded in a 1st-century Brahmi inscription over the entrance to the first cave.
                <br>
                This cave contains a 14-meter statue of the Buddha, carved out of the rock. However, the statue has been repainted countless times in the course of its history, and received its last coat of paint in the 20th century. 
            </p>
            <h3>Cave of the Great Kings</h3>

            </figure>
            <p>
                This is the second and largest cave, and has 16 standing and 40 seated statues of Budhha. In addition to the statues of Lord Buddha are statues of gods Saman and Vishnu, and the statues of King Vattagamani Abhaya and  King Nissanka Malla both of whom who contributed to the development of the cave temple during their reign.
                <br>
                Their contributions are indicated by a stone inscriptions at the cave's entrance and the cave is hence called Maharaja lena (in sinhala), or the "Cave of the Great Kings".
                <br>
                <br>
                This cave drips water from its ceiling which comes from a nearby spring and according to the locals this water is said to have healing powers.
                <br>
                The ceiling of cave is covered by murals decpicting scenes from Lord Buddha's life and also important events in the country's history.     
            </p>
            <h3>Great New Monastery</h3>
            <figure class="container">
                <img src="./images/Dambulla/Dambulla_Cave_Temple.webp" alt="Alot" class="main-img2">

            </figure>
            <p>
                The third cave, the Maha Alut Vihara (in sinhala), or the "Great New Monastery" has 50 Buddha statues and the statue of a king.
                <br>
                The cave has its ceiling and walls covered with paints from the 18th century.
